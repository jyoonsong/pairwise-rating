It would be like heaven if they could leave together now while everyone else was still studying or talking...she could just see them walking away from here into some other part of town...away from all these people who were staring at them even though they did not know them...they were staring as if they knew what it was like to be in love...\n\n\"It is like heaven,\" she said softly as if answering someone who had asked her how she felt about being in love...and looking up, she saw that he had gotten up from his table with his friends and come over to where she sat by herself studying; he sat down","author":"eguQTyzAbkJrbkt2Z","condition":"C","similarity":1.0,"draft":30.0,"words":280.0,"sentiment":0.9952,"allocated":0},{"index":29,"story":"\"I'm sorry,\" said Lily. \"I didn't mean to be rude.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to be so serious,\" Max said, and smiled at her.\n\n\"Do you want to go for a walk?\" Lily asked him. \"The night is beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Max said. \"Let's go for a walk.\" And they turned and walked down the avenue, not in the direction of the dance hall, but towards a park where they sat on a bench and talked about everything and anything until finally they found themselves looking at each other with amused grins on their faces.

It was a hot day, but Lily did not feel the heat. She and Max were too busy talking about what they wanted to do with their lives and where they wanted to live when they got old.\n\nLily wanted to travel around the world, so she said she would rather live in a small house in a big city than a big house in a small city.\n\nMax said he would rather live in a small house in the country near a stream than an enormous house on top of a hill overlooking the city he worked in. He said that he had always admired people who lived near rivers because they seemed to be more relaxed and content with their lives than people who lived downtown in large cities with tall buildings and cars speeding by every minute of the day.\n\nLily thought it was funny that Max had almost described her future, but she did not mention it because she didn't want him to get jealous because he was still talking about his own future when she had already described hers. She did not want him to feel that perhaps one day when they were old, she might leave him or something like that; so, instead, when he stopped talking and looked at her as if waiting for her answer, Lily just smiled at him and said: \"I think I'll like living near a river.\" And then Max asked her if she would like some ice cream; so they walked over to an ice cream parlour on the corner where they both decided on vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce for dipping it into...","author":"eguQTyzAbkJrbkt2Z","condition":"C","similarity":1.0,"draft":32.0,"words":287.0,"sentiment":0.9733,"allocated":0},{"index":31,"story":"\"It's almost eleven-thirty,\" Lily said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Max replied. \"I guess we should go back to the dance hall.\"\n\n\"Oh, Max,\" Lily said with a sigh. \"I wish this night would last forever.\"\n\nMax looked at her and smiled: \"It will last forever, you know.\" To prove his words, he took her hand and kissed it.
