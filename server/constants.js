Suddenly, Max walked up by her side. "I don't want to go in either," he said with a sigh.

Lily smiled at him; "Why not?" she asked curiously, but Max just shrugged his shoulders.
"It's Saturday tomorrow," Lily said after a moment of silence between them, "what are you going to do?"

"Read," he said simply, shoving his hands deep into his pockets.
"You're not going to read all day are you?" Lily laughed. "Besides, it's too hot in there for reading." Max laughed with her as they walked down the avenue together, talking about everything and anything until they found themselves looking`

"Hey," said Terry. "I just wanted to say that I think you're really pretty."

Caroline blushed and responded, "Thank you."
Terry asked if she wanted to get some coffee later, but Caroline told him she couldn't because of her class schedule.

The next day, Terry walked up to Caroline again in the hallway and they started talking. They both got coffee after class and hung out together for a while. They talked about their interests and who they wanted to be when they grew up.
Terry asked Caroline on a date later that week and she said yes. 
They ended up dating for 6 months until he broke her heart by cheating on her with his best friend's girlfriend`

"Oh, I know you do," she answered. "You're always trying to kiss me."

"That's because I love you."
"I think it's because you think I'm pretty."
"Well, aren't you?" he laughed. "And I love you for it."
“For being pretty?" she asked him with a smile. “How silly!"
“No," Max told her, “for not knowing that you are pretty." And he kissed her, right there on the corner where they were standing in the afternoon sun.

He put it into a frame. He bought a new shirt in order to match her eyes because they were blue like his. And one day when no one was at home, he kissed her picture because it was raining and no one could see him through glass of the rain-bow that she brought inside him with her blue eyes because she liked books and so did he; they both liked old books, especially those that had been written by writers who were dead for a long time as their love would be too.

The next day when no one was at home again, the woodpeckers outside were knocking on trees with their little beaks, but inside him everything was silent without her so he decided to cut out an oval piece of cardboard from an old box in order to make a frame which would be more beautiful than his love for paperbacks which nobody reads anymore except lovers of first editions who know what it means to kiss ink off paper while waiting for publishers' replies, or death...

"No, I don't," Lily answered.

Then Max said: "Let's go for a walk."

"All right," Lily agreed. So they went for a walk in the park where it was cool and dark. They were both feeling rather bored until suddenly Max put his arm around Lily's shoulders and gave her a gentle hug. It was a friendly hug and nothing more, but Lily felt as if she had just stopped breathing; then suddenly she grabbed hold of Max and they hugged each other all over the place in the dark park under the trees that smelled like lilac and fresh bread. And when it began to rain they ran home hand in hand...

Lily came walking up to him, a book under her arm. She put down her book next to his, and smiled when she saw that he had no glasses on and was looking straight at her face.
“Hello, Max," she said softly; "I haven't seen you for ages."
“Hello," Max said; "I've been busy – I'm almost finished my thesis."
“Oh, you're still working on that? You've been working so hard..." Lily sounded disappointed. “I thought you'd be happy now it's almost done."
“Yes," Max sighed; "I am happy." He sat up when he heard the playground bell ring loudly in the distance, over by the high-gabled school building with the tall clock tower that made a little face appear every time it struck two or four or six, but not on quarter hours – not enough time between strikes for its round-faced little face to make another appearance atop its almond-shaped body with its big hands pointing to the quarter hour...but that was later – much later...and now read on:

"Hello..." said the second stranger. He could tell that the first stranger was troubled and he wanted to help him.

"Hello..." said the first stranger, who wasn't so troubled anymore because someone was kind enough to talk to him. The second stranger asked him what was troubling him, so the first one told his story about his wife who had left him for another man. The second one commiserated with him and told how he sometimes went through similar experiences in his life as well, even though it had been a long time since he had last seen his wife. The first one found out that they were from two different countries, but they ended up spending all day talking and walking together, and went back to their hotels together that night before calling it a day. In another town they might have met in separate hotel rooms by themselves that night; but instead they were in one room talking, sharing their experiences with each other, commiserating together about love and life. They became friends on that day; not only because of similarity of circumstances but also because of kindness: giving your sympathy when it is needed most is something any human being can do for another human being, no matter where you come from or where you are going to...

She said yes because it was hot in the dance hall; then they walked over to his brother’s house and sat on the porch swing while they talked about how much more fun it is to do everything with someone you love; then Max told her he had something in his pocket that belonged to her, so he reached into his pocket and pulled out a little black box...

Lily played on, one movement after another, not heeding any of the sounds around her, until she played the last note. "There," she sighed. "That's it."

Max came up to her smilingly. "The music sounded exactly as I'd imagined it would," he said.

"And why shouldn't it?" Lily asked him lightly. "We wrote it together."

"Yes," Max agreed; then he added: "You know I love you."

"Why shouldn't you?" Lily countered; then she added: "And I love you too". Then they were both silent for they knew that they had said everything that needed to be said between them...

They discussed these subversive passages with one another for a while, and then they liked each other so much that they decided to get married.

At first John thought it was a pity that Mary was not a boy, because he thought that if she had been, she would have made an excellent friend for life; but on second thought he decided that this was not so bad after all. What he liked about Mary was her laughter, her softness and her hair which fell softly around her face; and as time went by, John realized that his wife was a girl after all.

"I'm glad you're my husband," Mary said once when they had been married for eight years and two children; "you always understand me." And John agreed with his wife. He often did understand her, although sometimes it seemed to him as if she were completely different from everyone else he had ever known.

One morning when John came into the kitchen where his wife was making breakfast for their children (who were now eight years old themselves), he said: "I think I'm going out of my mind", and his wife laughed softly as she put some eggs on a plate; then she looked up at him and touched him gently on the cheek to reassure him: "No you're not," she said tenderly; "you're not going out of your mind at all - you're growing up."

“Let's go for a walk," said Max. “Let's go to the cinema instead," Lily answered.
Lily and her best friend went to the cinema. It was the first time they went together without their boyfriends, and they enjoyed it very much. Their boyfriends were very jealous when they found out that they had gone to see a film without them, but they agreed with their girlfriends later that evening that it was fun to think about all these things that had happened between them: laughing at all those stupid stories they told each other; being in love with one another; liking each other enough to want to kiss each other...

There was a sign that said: "GOVERNMENT HOUSE" that led to an outside terrace and we sat down to get our breath back.

"I wonder if this is what it's like to be in love," I said looking up at the yellow brick buildings around us, "I'm sure I'm not but everything looks different suddenly."

"It's late summer," Rowena replied dreamily; "see how quiet it is? It doesn't look like Cambridge at all."

"It's probably because it's late," I said, still looking around me with my eyes shining. "Harvard Square must be much different at night."

"I bet it is," Rowena answered; then she turned to me—"Do you think either one of us will ever see Harvard Square again after today?" she asked me with her eyes as wide as if she were trying to catch a glimpse of her own future through them.

"I don't have a watch," the woman said after she glanced at her wrist. "But I can tell you what time it is by heart."

The man looked shocked at this statement, but since it was getting dark he said: "All right then, tell me what time it is by heart."

"It's quarter past three," she answered.

The man smiled and walked away without thanking her. He didn't believe that anyone could possibly know what time it was by heart at such a precise moment as half past three in the afternoon. The woman smiled too as she watched him walk away from her into the crowd. She knew that no one would ever ask her how she knew the time so precisely, because no one would believe that someone could have learned to tell clock time by heart, especially when the minutes were not matching up with the hours of a day; yet this was how other people thought about themselves all the time, thinking that they must look like everyone else if they're dressed in clothes with pockets or wallets or handbags that are made out of exactly these items - wallets and handbags - and nothing else...

"I love you," said Max to Lily. "I've been wanting to tell you for a long time."

"I love you too," said Lily back. Then she leaned over close to Max's face and whispered: "Let's go somewhere where nobody can see us."

"Then why don't we get married?" asked Max and in reply he received a kiss from Lily.

And he was a good friend, too: whenever someone came to his house who had nowhere else to go for the night, Moishe always had a place for him on the couch near the warm stove; and no one ever left his home hungry because Moishe always first of all sat down with his guests and ate what there was himself before feeding anyone else.
Moisey's friends all liked him: Shmuel who could do everything with his hands like carving and painting and making things; Yankel who could draw; Boris who could do magic tricks.

Every night when the show was over, Lily went out for a walk because she was restless after being on her feet most of the evening.

"You have to meet her yourself," Harry insisted.
“I would like to," Max agreed, "but I already have a steady girl and I don't want to cause any trouble."

"I don't think there's going to be any trouble," Harry said as he looked at his watch; "she should be here any minute now."
“Then why don't you wait for her at the door?" Max suggested. “I think I'll have another coffee.”
“All right," Harry answered, and he went out on the sidewalk to meet his girl. When she came walking toward him, Harry grabbed her arm and hurried her rather roughly into the coffee shop where she could best see Max. “That's my friend," he said, introducing them quickly; then he left at once without saying another word because he didn't want to miss a moment of his date with this exciting new girl who knew how to keep him waiting for over an hour before arriving with a mild apology.

Harry's friend was Alice, and when she saw Max sitting alone at their table in the coffee shop looking so very sad that it broke her heart (and this is why she had been so late), Alice sat down beside him without saying a word and without waiting for Harry's approval or permission...

"Name?" he asked as soon as she sat down at the counter where he could keep an eye on her.

"Yours first," Lily answered, taking pen from behind her ear and leaning forward over the counter.

Lily wrote Max on the top of her application form, then turned it around in order not to lose her place, when she discovered that Max was looking at her very strangely, so she looked up at him too, but his eyes seemed suddenly very far away -- like someone dreaming -- so Lily went back to staring at him with curiosity until finally: "Is there something wrong with you?"

He stared back at her without thinking about anything until she finally got up and came over to his table.

"Hello," said Max, looking at her even harder than before because this time she wasn't even pretending to look away from him either. "I don't know why I'm looking at you like this," he told her finally, "but you're the first person I've ever seen who doesn't make me feel lonesome."

"You feel lonesome?" Lily asked him in surprise; "why should anybody feel lonesome?"

They danced until it was time for her to go home, then they went outside together under the big street lamp which shone down on them from between two maple trees in spring bloom. The street light made them feel romantic, so they talked about love until they found themselves telling each other little things about themselves as if they had known each other for years. They were both lonely and unhappy, so their loneliness grew less as they walked together through the spring night which smelled like lilacs and fresh bread...

It was a warm June day and they were talking about everything – about how much they liked each other, and about how funny it was that they had not realized it before, but now that they did realize it, all they could think of was that they wanted to be together. They hugged each other and kissed each other.

They were in love with each other.`

Max would be there all night if they left him alone. It was too early for the place to be crowded. A few people came in, looked around and left again, but Max didn't notice any of them or he didn't care if he did. At that moment, someone tapped him on the shoulder and asked: "Mind if I join you?"

Max shook his head. "Have a seat," he said.

The man took off his coat and sat down on a stool next to Max's barstool; then reached for the paper lying on the bar, looked at it for a while, folded it up again and threw it down onto the counter with disgust saying: "What kind of town is this anyway?"

"What do you mean?" Max asked him; "there's nothing wrong with this town."

"Oh yeah?" said the man; "what would you say this town needs? Tell me that." He had started talking with passion in his voice; now he had both elbows on the counter and looked around like someone who was about to deliver a speech.

Max shrugged his shoulders. "I'm not from here," he said. "But what kind of town do you want? A good place for business maybe? What do you do anyway?" He had become interested in this man who had come into the bar so suddenly that`

"Let's go for a walk," Max suggested to Lily; but she refused because she knew the boys would follow them.
“I'm sorry," Lily said, "but I don't feel like going for a walk."

“I'll call you tomorrow," said Max; then he went away.

Lily felt embarrassed and humiliated, but she hadn't expected anything else. She had been asking for it by going out with a boy like Max. Everybody knew that he wasn’t good enough for her, but Lily thought she knew better than other people – not better than her parents, but certainly better than all those girls who giggled behind her back when they saw her with him on the street or in the movies or at the tennis club where they played tennis every Sunday with all those boys who were so good-looking and had such nice cars. And now here she was in this stupid party, half drunk and surrounded by silly boys who never left her alone and who thought their being there made a difference to her – if they didn't think that themselves! – and one of them even dared to touch her! And nobody helped her! Everybody looked on as if it were funny! Even those girls who giggled behind her back would have come to her rescue if they'd happened`

I walked along the corridor quickly past the rows of doors with their frosted-glass panels. Each door was labeled with a name plate. The letters were not very clear in the dim light of the corridor; I had to squint at them. When I reached my office, I had to knock at first; but Mrs. Russell opened the door right away because she had been waiting for me behind it for quite some time already. She looked upset and told me that she'd put off going home for as long as she could just because she was afraid that something would happen to her before she saw me again. She told me again how much she loved me and asked me if there wasn't anything we could do about it -- but there wasn't, so we both tried not to think about it anymore after that night...

Suddenly, Max broke off his story to look at Lily and hold her hand. "I love you," he said.
"I love you, too," Lily answered, smiling happily, "And I'm so glad we're going away together on vacation again."
"What do you mean?" Max asked in surprise: "We didn't go anywhere together during our vacation."
“Yes we did," Lily said. "That day when we rowed out to the middle of the Aegean Sea and I fell overboard and nearly sank before you fished me out--that was really an interesting day!"

She was so excited that she could hardly concentrate during class, but finally it was over and she ran from the classroom to the student center with a special smile on her face.

When she got there, he wasn't there yet. She sat down at one of the tables and opened her book to study for an exam that was coming up next week. Then he walked in with some friends and sat down at a table far from hers; but he looked at her and smiled.

She felt like jumping out of her chair, running over to him, taking his hand without saying anything, and then dragging him out of there; anywhere else would be better than here...with his friends! It would be like heaven if they could leave together now while everyone else was still studying or talking...she could just see them walking away from here into some other part of town...away from all these people who were staring at them even though they did not know them...they were staring as if they knew what it was like to be in love...

He had decided to take her out for breakfast.

Lily loved to sleep late on Saturdays and she never got up before ten-thirty. But Max knew that she would want to get something to eat, so he had brought his car and waited outside her building until she finally came out dressed in jeans and a green cotton shirt.

"I'm starving," Lily said as Max helped her into the front seat of his car. "I haven't eaten anything since yesterday." She put her arms around him as he started the engine. "What you're doing is very sweet," she told him, "but I'm not hungry."

Max took her arms away from around his neck and held them by her side: "Don't do that," he said simply. "You know I love you." Then he drove off quickly so that she couldn't answer him, because he knew that what he had just said was true, and now it had been said, there was no turning back. He drove through the streets in silence until they arrived at a little coffee shop where there were only a few people eating breakfast at tables outside on the sidewalk...`

Max nodded and watched her go down the avenue. He did not try to follow her because he knew that sometimes a person needs to be alone when they are sad and that it is best not to interrupt them when they want to be alone.

He stood there for a while, waiting for her, even though he knew that she would not come back. When she did not return, Max went away too, walking down the avenue until it turned into a street and then into smaller streets until finally he came upon an alley where no one walked after dark, especially people like him who were strangers in town. He thought about turning back but decided against it and continued on his way, following the alley until he came upon an old house with an old woman sitting in front of it on a chair under a dim street lamp. The house looked dark except for one window which was lit by the flickering light of a candle. The old woman sat there staring at him as he walked up and stood before her, motionless with fear. She was old and very thin; her face was covered with wrinkles and she wore glasses with thick lenses which made her eyes look very big behind them; yet there was something about them which made Max feel sad when he looked at them... They reminded him of Lily's eyes as he had seen them last night... And suddenly he remembered that night: it had`

"How about going out for dinner?" Max asked. "There's this new Chinese restaurant near my place that I'd like to try out tonight."

"All right," Lily said. "That sounds nice." She had no idea why he wanted to take her to dinner, but they had gone out before and she liked Max so she was glad that he had called her up and asked her out again.

"I'll pick you up around seven-thirty," he said, and then he hung up before she could say anything else. She decided that it did not matter; it was just dinner anyway... what could go wrong?

At precisely seven-thirty, Max knocked at her door. She opened it and saw him standing there with a bouquet of red roses in his hand, smiling at her as if he were waiting for her to say something; but she did not know what to say because she had never received flowers from any man before... so she just smiled back at him and took the flowers from his hands and put them down on the table in the hallway without saying anything; then they left for dinner together...

He was the only one who ever had a conversation with her, and she thought he might ask her out if she stayed long enough.

"Let's go for a walk," Max suggested as he came up to Lily. "It's hot in here."

"All right," Lily said gladly. "But I have to be back by ten."

They walked up and down the avenue, talking comfortably about everything and anything until finally, they found themselves looking at each other with amused grins on their faces.

"We've been through this before," Max said, indicating all that they had talked about on their walk up the avenue; then he added: "But isn't it funny how you can enjoy talking about yourself?"

Lily wanted to travel around the world, so she said she would rather live in a small house in a big city than a big house in a small city.

Max said he would rather live in a small house in the country near a stream than an enormous house on top of a hill overlooking the city he worked in. He said that he had always admired people who lived near rivers because they seemed to be more relaxed and content with their lives than people who lived downtown in large cities with tall buildings and cars speeding by every minute of the day.

Lily thought it was funny that Max had almost described her future, but she did not mention it because she didn't want him to get jealous because he was still talking about his own future when she had already described hers. She did not want him to feel that perhaps one day when they were old, she might leave him or something like that; so, instead, when he stopped talking and looked at her as if waiting for her answer, Lily just smiled at him and said: "I think I'll like living near a river." And then Max asked her if she would like some ice cream; so they walked over to an ice cream parlour on the corner where they both decided on vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce for dipping it into...`

She had come here with a girl friend, but her friend had found someone to go home with and had left an hour ago. Lily was tired of sitting alone in the corner watching everyone else have such a good time, so she decided to go home herself.

"I'll wait until Max comes," she thought as she stood up and began to walk across the dance floor; "then I'll ask him for a ride."

It was then that she saw Max standing at the entrance looking around for her. He saw her at once and walked towards her. She met him half way in the middle of the floor. He looked at her closely; his eyes were almost sad as he asked: "Where's your date?" Lily did not answer immediately, but looked away from him out over the dancers, who were still dancing just as hard as when they had first come in two hours before, and said: "I don't know where he is."

Lily shrugged her shoulders and walked away from him towards the door; then she turned around: "Wait for me," she said before disappearing into the night. Max stood there alone on the dance floor waiting for Lily to return so that they could finish their dance together; but Lily never came back...`

"We've been through this before," Max said, indicating all that they had talked about on their walk up the avenue; then he added: "But isn't it funny how you can enjoy talking about yourself?"

"Yes," Lily admitted; "it is funny." Then she asked him: "What makes you think you know so much about me?"

Max laughed at her question: "What makes you think I know so much about myself?" he countered, but his question was not answered because suddenly they realized that they were in love and that everything else had been just talking before that moment when they stood looking at each other in the bright light of a street lamp on Friday night at eleven-thirty when everyone else was dancing and having fun but them...

Lily turned to Max and smiled.
A feeling of warmth rushed through her body as she looked into his eyes. She felt like running away with him, far away where no one would ever bother them. The two of them would never have to leave their room again; they could just stay there together, happy forever. Ah, if only love would last forever! But no, it could not be like that; it had to end sometime... Anyway, now was not a time for sadness. Lily smiled again as she thought of how happy she was this very moment. Why waste time thinking? Tomorrow would come soon enough`

Max was sitting on a chair in the room, reading a book by the light of the lamp beside him. He looked up from his book occasionally to look at Lily, and then he would go back to his reading.

It had been raining for a week now and Lily was feeling depressed. She had developed a cold after going out in her raincoat without an umbrella. She spent most of her days in bed with a hot-water bottle on her feet and a cold compress over her forehead. She would cough feebly from time to time and she could barely keep herself awake all day long to read or listen to music on the radio. It had been like that for five days and Max had been taking care of her since Monday: bringing her warm milk to drink, changing her hot-water bottle when it got cold, putting more coal into the stove when it began to cool down in the evening, bringing up blankets when it began to get chilly at night...

He never said much during those days because he knew she was not well enough even to talk, but he did things for her with an ease which showed how much he knew about sickness; he brought things smoothly into their place as if he were used to do such things every day of his life; as if they were old married people who shared all their secrets together...

Lily was coughing again now and Max got up from his chair immediately. He came over to where Lily stood and`

Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a small town with her two stepmothers and two stepsisters. She worked hard all day, and always wore rags and went barefoot. Her stepsisters were beautiful and wore fine dresses. They were cruel to her, but she did not complain. Her only friend was a little bird who lived in the attic of the house where she lived.

One day the prince from another country came to visit the king of that country. The prince was handsome, gentle and kind. He asked people to dance at the ball, but no one wanted to dance with him because he had come alone – without his parents or friends – so everyone thought he was poor. Then he saw Cinderella sitting by herself in the corner of the ballroom; so he asked her to dance with him – he did not know who she was or that she had no gowns for such a grand ball; all he knew was that she looked like an angel in rags, so innocent and sweet. They danced together until midnight when all the girls ran away as if they had seen ghosts (which they thought they had). But Cinderella stayed behind because she loved him very much already even though they had just met; then Cinderella ran away too because she did not want him to find out who she really was: a poor girl wearing rags who worked hard every day...

He looked around at the people dancing and talking to each other, but he could not find anyone interesting enough to talk to. So he went out on the balcony where he sat alone looking at the street lights below him.

He thought about Lily. She had been away on a trip for a whole week, and now she was back in town. He wanted to see her again, but he did not want to go near her house because he did not want anyone else asking him who she was or why he wanted to speak to her. Max liked Lily a lot, but it was too soon for him to introduce her to his friends; so until then, he did not want anyone else knowing that she existed or even being able to find out who she was.

The music started playing inside again and Max left the balcony of the dance hall with a sigh; it was ten-thirty: time for him to go home anyway.

As he walked home from the bus stop towards his apartment building, Max wondered what Lily would be doing at that hour of Thursday night. He hoped that she would be asleep by then... It was too late for them to do anything together now anyway... Tomorrow morning they would see each other again... It would be all right tomorrow morning... They could do something then... In fact, what they would do tomorrow morning might just turn out better than a dance hall... Even though their first meeting had taken place`

She was looking at the people at the party. They were all strangers to her. She had been invited by a friend who had suddenly decided to go to Paris and had asked Lily to take his place.

Lily was bored. She wanted to go home. But she did not want to leave before her host returned from Paris, so she stayed on at the party and tried to be interested in what was going on around her.

She stared at the people here and there in the room. They all seemed to be crazily dancing with someone, or else sitting at tables drinking and laughing loudly. There did not seem to be any quiet and sober person at the party, except for one man who stood alone near a window looking out into the street below. He had dark hair and his back was turned towards Lily as she watched him from across the room where she stood alone with her glass of whisky and soda in her hand.

Who is that man? Lily thought as she put down her glass back to the table and slowly walked towards him: Who is that man? She still wondered when she stood opposite him, looking into his deep black eyes which were smiling at her over a glass of whisky and soda he held in his hand: Who is that man? What is he doing here? Why is he smiling? Is he expecting someone? And why am I so fascinated with him when there are so`

"What are you thinking?" Lily asked him, putting down the book she was reading.

"I'm in love," Max said, and he meant it.

Lily, however, did not believe him. She thought he was just telling her what she wanted to hear...

She was crying. He couldn't keep himself from going up to her and asking her what was wrong. She said she didn't know. Maybe it was something she ate. Or maybe it was because she had to wait for the bus home while watching everyone else walk off without having to wait for one. He offered to walk her home, and she told him how nice that would be but that they'd never get home before midnight. It was already eleven in the evening and he had to be at work by seven in the morning. He suggested taking a taxi, but that meant money that they didn't have, and anyway, it wouldn't get them there any faster than walking would.

"I'm sorry," she said with tears in her eyes as she stood up and prepared to board the bus that would take her away from him forever if he didn't do something right then...

He only liked to sit on the shore of the lake and watch the lights slowly disappearing as the sun rose higher in the sky each day. The sun seemed so much bigger in those early hours of each day when Max sat by himself and kept still, watching its slow journey from east to west across the sky.

After a while Max would get up, stretch himself and go home for breakfast with his family. And as he ate breakfast with them, he would wonder again why he had been born into this world to live such a dull life with people who bored him to death with their talk and their constant demands on him that he pay attention to them and what they were doing or saying all the time.

Max did not want to live anymore! He did not want to eat breakfast with his family every day. He did not want to go to work where everyone expected him to smile at their jokes even though they were boring and stupid jokes that even children would have laughed at if they had told them! Max wanted to die! And yet...he did not want to die either! He was confused about everything in his life and felt that there must be some way out of all this boredom...some way out of this cloud hanging over his head in which there was no sunshine or happiness...some way out of his loveless marriage...some way out of being stuck in`

"Yes," Max said. "Let's go for a walk." And they turned and walked down the avenue, not in the direction of the dance hall, but towards a park where they sat on a bench and talked about everything and anything until finally they found themselves looking at each other with amused grins on their faces.

Max was standing in the middle of the room looking around him as he sipped his drink. He was bored. He wanted to go home, but his host had not returned from Paris yet so he waited for him patiently while all his friends tried to entertain him by dancing with him or asking him questions or telling jokes or talking about everything under the sun until finally Max became irritated by all their efforts and decided that it was time for him to leave, but no one noticed that he had gone because everyone else was busy having fun...

"I'm glad you're here," he said, as we began to walk down the familiar avenue to his home. "I missed seeing you recently."

"I have been busy with school," I told him. "It's hard studying every day."

"Yes," Max agreed. "I see how that is." Then he added: "I was thinking of asking you to come and stay with me tomorrow, if that's possible?"

"But my parents would wonder where I am!" I cried out in dismay.

Max laughed: "Don't worry about that," he said. "I'll tell them you're visiting some friends! And besides, if we don't get away sometimes, then we'd never be able to... well... get out and see new things... like the lake..." His voice trailed off into a whisper and when I looked up at him, his eyes were full of longing. I moved towards him slowly and he put his arms around me gently and drew me close to him until our lips met in a sweet, tender kiss that sent shivers down my spine. We walked on quietly then until we came within sight of Max's home where his father was getting up from under the hood of his car when we passed by on our way inside. He nodded hello to me with a welcoming smile on his face before wiping his hands on an old rag and going back under the hood again. Then we went in through the kitchen door as Max held it open for me without taking his arm from around my shoulders. All afternoon Max talked about wanting to take me for a sail across the lake and afterwards have dinner somewhere nice ,`
